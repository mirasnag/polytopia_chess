# Polytopia Chess Clone MVP

An implementation of a simplified chess-like strategy game using units and mechanics inspired by _The Battle of Polytopia_. This MVP provides a local, single-player experience on an 8Ã—8 grid, featuring basic movement, combat, action points, and win/lose conditions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Single Game State** stored in **LocalStorage** for **New Game** / **Resume Game**
- **Grid-Based Board**: 8Ã—8 square map with `Tile` entities storing coordinates and occupant
- **Units**: Six unit types (`warrior`, `archer`, `rider`, `catapult`, `knight`, `mind bender`), each with base stats and skills
- **Action Points**: Players receive a fixed number of AP per turn (scales every 10 turns) to move, attack, or use skills
- **Skills**: Passive (`dash`, `escape`, `relentless`) and active (`charge`, `heal`, `multiAttack`, `longShot`) abilities with AP costs
- **Turn Management**: Handles player order, AP budget, and per-unit action flags (`canMove`, `canAttack`)
- **Win Condition**: Capture the enemy `mind bender` (king) or resign
